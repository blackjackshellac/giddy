== Hardlinks

hardlink from metadata dir (directory tree) to content dir
cd metadata_dir
ln @content_dir/@content_file filename

When deleting a file from the metadata dir, if the link count
is 2 before the delete that means there is only the two files
and the content_file can also be deleted,

if File.stat(filename).nlinks == 2
	rm filename
	rm @content_dir/@content_file
end
